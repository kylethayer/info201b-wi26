    "There are several species of salmon and most are anadromous, which means they are born in rivers and creeks, go out to sea to live, and return to breed (often in the same river or creek of their birth). Most salmon spend up to a couple years at sea before returning in Autumn in a seasonal migration and spawning event called a salmon run. Around Seattle, there are many fewer locations that support the reproductive cycle of salmon than existed in recent centuries. However, Northwest Seattle's Carkeek Park has been maintained by the Carkeek Watershed Community Action Project ([CWCAP](https://www.carkeekwatershed.org/mission/)) as an educational site with creeks that support (partly) a live salmon run. After decades of work to restore the wetlands around the park, salmon now return in Autumn to spawn. As it turns out, the conditions at the park do not allow many of the eggs laid by the salmon to survive long enough to become fry (the name for baby salmon). However, the population is supported by the additional release of fry that are born and temporarily raised at the Grover's Creek Salmon Hatchery, which is ran by the Suquamish Tribe in Poulsbo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Autumn, you can visit the creeks in the park and see salmon swim upstream to spawn as well as the carcasses of salmon -- which die after spawning. You can check out [this video by the Seattle Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JAcvXAr44) to get a sense of what this looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year for several decades, volunteers with CWCAP conduct a survey to try to count all the living and dead salmon that come in the salmon run, as well as the redds (nests) that salmon build there. In 2024, a record number of salmon were observed at more than 3000, where the previous record in recent decades was less than 1000. The volunteers collect other information about the salmon and carcasses tht they observe and make it available publicly. While the 2024 record year data is not yet released, we can check out the 2023 data! Let's check out that data to answer a question:\n",
